@Autowired
Spring provides annotation-based auto-wiring by providing @Autowired annotation. It is used to autowire spring bean
on setter methods, instance variable, and constructor. When we use @Autowired annotation, the spring container
auto-wires the bean by matching data-type.

@Service
It tells the Spring that class contains the business logic.
